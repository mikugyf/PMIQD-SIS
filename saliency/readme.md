
### Saliency
Use the [DINet](https://github.com/MRzzm/DINet) visual saliency models to generate the saliency predictions by capturing features at different scales and combining structure with global scene information.


In the PMIQD-SIS we use the eye movement data to fine-tune DINet to be suitable for the salient areas prediction and obtain the saliency map feature.
